    <p>In a lengthy statement released on Friday, the former first lady condemned the shooting of Jacob Blake, a
        Wisconsin man shot seven times in the back by police in front of his children, as well as the shooting of three
        protesters by an alleged 17-year-old rightwing militant in the protests that followed.

        <br>“I’m just devastated by the shootings in Kenosha,” she wrote. “Like so many of you, I’m exhausted and
        frustrated right now. It’s a weight that I know Black and Brown people all across the country are shouldering
        once again. And we’re so often left wondering how things will get better.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> had some pointed words for the Trump administration as well, condemning the “lack of empathy, division
        stoked in times of crisis and age-old and systemic racism” that is seen across the country, on the news, and
        “from the White House Rose Garden”.</p>
