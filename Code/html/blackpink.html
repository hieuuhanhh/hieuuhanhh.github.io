        <p>BLACKPINK and Selena Gomez had gotten together over a video call to tease the release of the new song. All of
            them were excited for the release as per the video that was shared on BLACKPINK’s channel on Youtube.
            BLACKPINK's new song with Selena was first teased in the last week of July and fans had guessed that the
            collab
            might be with Selena. At the moment, BLACKPINK's new song with Selena has already recorded almost 32 million
            views in just six hours. The song is being streamed by 'Selpink' as per fansites. Selpink is apparently a
            combination of Selena and BLACKPINK's fans. The term is used by both the pop acts several times on Instagram
            captions and more. </p>

        <p>It will be a first time for Selena Gomez to be collaborating with any K-pop group. However, BLACKPINK has
            collaborated with pop stars like Lady Gaga and Dua Lipa before this. With the former, they have the song
            Sour
            Candy and with the latter they have released the song Kiss and Make-Up in the past. The group is soon going
            to
            release a full album under the title, 'The Album' as per their recent Instagram account announcement. </p>
